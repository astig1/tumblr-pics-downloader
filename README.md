tumblr-pics-downloader
======================

It will download all the jpg, bmp, png, gif files to your destination folder. 
It's very fast because of parallelization.

The downloader is based on the David Shaw's Tumblr_scrape.
Check his code out and compare to mine to see where the differences are.

The main difference: speed.
I am going to add other websites so that you can get pictures not only from tumblr, but let's say,
also from mmm-tasty.ru.

If only I were a regexp pro it would be already done :)

If you like the idea and want me to further improve the code let me know by pressing the button.
